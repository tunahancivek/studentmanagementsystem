Explanation

The code provided is a comprehensive JavaFX application designed for managing students, their enrollments in courses, and their grades. JavaFX is used to create desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. Let's walk through the key components and functionalities of this application:
Imports
The code begins with importing necessary JavaFX classes for building the UI, handling events, and managing data collections. These imports enable the creation of stages (windows), scenes (content containers within windows), layout managers, controls (like buttons and tables), and data structures for managing dynamic data.
Main Application Class
HelloApplication extends Application, making it the main class of a JavaFX application. It overrides the start method, which is the entry point for JavaFX applications.
ObservableLists
ObservableList is used for storing dynamic data that the UI can automatically update when changes occur. Here, lists are used for managing students, courses, and grades. The courses list is initialized with three courses: "Math", "Science", "History".
Student-Course-Grades Map
A HashMap called studentCourseGrades associates students with their courses and grades. Each student (a String key) is associated with another Map (value) that maps course names to grades.
UI Components
* TableView (studentTable): Displays the list of students. It's initialized and configured in the initializeStudentTable method.
* MenuBar: Contains menus for students, courses, and grades. Each menu item triggers different forms and functionalities, such as adding or updating student details, enrolling students in courses, and assigning grades.
Methods for UI and Functionality
* start: Sets up the main window, initializes the student table, and configures the layout.
* createMenuBar: Creates the menu bar and its menus and items, configuring their event handlers.
* initializeStudentTable: Initializes the table view for displaying student names.
* showStudentDetails: Shows detailed information for a selected student, including courses and grades, in a new window.
* showAddOrUpdateStudentForm: Displays a form for adding a new student or updating an existing one.
* showEnrollStudentForm: Presents a form for enrolling a student in a course.
* showAssignGradeForm: Opens a form for assigning a grade to a student for a specific course.
* showAlert: Utility method for showing informational alerts/dialogs.
Event Handling
Event handlers are attached to menu items to perform actions like showing forms for adding or updating students, enrolling in courses, and assigning grades. The lambda expressions (e -> {...}) define inline event handling logic.
Scene and Stage
Scenes contain all UI components and are set on stages (windows). Each form and the main window are stages, which can display scenes containing layouts and controls. Modality is used for forms to block interaction with other windows until the form is closed.
Summary
This application leverages JavaFX's capabilities for building a desktop application that manages student information, course enrollments, and grades. It demonstrates the use of UI components, event handling, and data management in a JavaFX application.
